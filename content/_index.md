# Dungeon Party
#### *Proudly presented by 9hack Studios*
<br />
*Mario Party.*

*The Binding of Isaac.*

*Super Mario Maker.*


Inspired by these genre-defining games, *Dungeon Party* is unique spin on what makes these games fun. It's a blend of craftiness, competition, and chaos.

We're creating a game that contains both the sense of exploration and discovery of dungeon crawlers, and the chaotic and competitive interactions of a party game. By combining these two together, we're building a game where players can compete with each other in mini games, use the points they obtain to collectively build a dungeon full of both hazards and treasures, and traverse this dungeon while avoiding their opponentâ€™s obstacles. Players compete to have the most amount of gold by the end of the game by avoiding obstacles, winning mini games, and stealing from your opponents.
